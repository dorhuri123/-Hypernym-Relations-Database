# -Hypernym-Relations-Database
<Bold>A little preview</Bold> - Hypernymy (also called IS-A relation) is a semantic relation between two noun phrases, hypernym and hyponym, such that the hyponym is a subtype of the hypernym. For example, cat and dog are hyponym of animal because they are types of animals. Hypernym relations are hierarchical, so a word can have multiple hypernyms. For example, dog is a hyponym of animal, canine and mammal.
